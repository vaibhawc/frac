# frac
An attempt at presenting koch curves (fractals).
The UI part is still WIP, so please bear with me.
The input box is to put an angle from 0.00 rads to 3.14 rads.
Green box, on touch, produces one step. The production gets slower as the steps increase. It should halt after 6 steps.
Red box is to reset everything.

Written in ClojureScript + shadow-cljs. 
You can access the app at vaibhawc.github.io/frac/.
